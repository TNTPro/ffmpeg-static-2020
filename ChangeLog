3.1 and 3.1s
 Do we NEED to 'disable shared' on the libs we build, because if you install the static libs, often they install the shared libs also?
 Does it just matter which build options we use (i.e. --pkg-config-flags=--static and --extra-ldexeflags=-static) in ffmpeg configure?
 The 's' version tries to 'static' everything; the other does not.
